-- Maid[key] = (function)            Adds a function to call at cleanup
-- Maid[key] = (Instance)            Adds an Object to be Destroyed at cleanup
-- Maid[key] = (RBXScriptConnection) Adds a connection to be Disconnected at cleanup
-- Maid[key] = (Maid)                Maids can act as an event connection, allowing a Maid to have other maids to clean up.
-- Maid[key] = nil                   Removes a named task. This cleans up the previous Maid[key]


--- Generates a new Maid object
-- @return Maid
function Maid.new()
	return setmetatable({_Tasks = {}}, Maid)
end

--- Gives the Maid a Task to perform at cleanup, incremented by 1
-- @param Variant Task An object to be Destroyed, a Connection to be Disconnected, or function/callable table to be called
-- @returns the index the Task was placed at
function Maid:GiveTask(Task)
	local TaskId = #self._Tasks + 1
	self._Tasks[TaskId] = Task
	return TaskId
end

--- Makes the Maid clean up when the instance is destroyed
-- @param Instance Instance The Instance the Maid will wait for to be Destroyed
-- @returns Disconnectable table to stop Maid from being cleaned up upon Instance Destroy (automatically cleaned up by Maid, btw)
